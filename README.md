# javascript-whiz-quiz

## Purpose
With this challenge, I wanted to creat a JavaScript quiz that would help test students on their knowledge of JavaScript. Once the student pressed the start quiz button, a timer is started and the first question and answer choices pop up. For each question that the student chooses the correct answer, two points are added to their score. At the end of the game they have the option to add their initials to a for that logs the high scores for the quiz.
